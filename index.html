  <h1> What is Lorem Ipsum? </h1>

        <p>
           <b>Lorem Ipsum </b>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <br>
           industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
           text ever since the <mark>1500s</mark>, when an unknown printer took a galley <br>
           of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has <br>
           survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic <br>
           typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in <br>
           the <mark>1960s</mark> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem <br>
           Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing <br> 
           software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
        </p>

   <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>  

        <p>
           It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the <br>
           readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of <br>
           using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution <br>
           of letters, as opposed to using <q>Content here, content here</q>, <br>
           making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing <br>
           packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their <br>
           default model text, and a search for <q> <i>lorem ipsum</i> </q> will uncover <br>
           many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved <br>
           over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose <br>
           (injected humour and the like).

   <h3>Where does it come from?</h3>
       <p>
        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. <br>
        It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, <br>
        making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin <br>
        professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of <br>
        the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum <br>
        passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical <br>
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum <br>
        comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum <br>
        et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in <br>
        45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular <br>
        during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem <br>
        ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br>
        <br>
        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is <br>
        reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and <br>
        1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also <br>
        reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English <br>
        versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
